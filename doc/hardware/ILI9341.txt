Serial Interface
----------------
From Documentation
The serial interface is initialized when CSX is high status. In this state, SCL clock pulse and SDA
	data are no effect.
A falling edge on CSX enables the serial interface and indicates the start of data transmission.
Host processor drives the CSX pin to low and starts by setting the D/CX bit on SDA
The bit is read by ILI9341 on the first rising edge of SCL signal.
On the next falling edge of SCL, the MSB data bit (D7) is set on SDA by the host.
On the next falling edge of SCL, the next bit (D6) is set on SDA.
Any instruction can be sent in any order to ILI9341 and the MSB is transmitted first.
If the D/CX bit is "low", the transmission byte is interpreted as a command byte.
If the D/CX bit is "high", the transmission byte is stored as the display data RAM (Memory write command), or command register as parameter.
ILI9341 latches the SDA (input data) at the rising edges of SCL (serial clock)
And then shifts SDA (output data) at falling edges of SCL (serial clock)
After the read status command has been sent, the SDA line must be set to tri-state and no later than
	at the falling edge of SCL of the last bit.

Notes
// NOTE: MSB first.
// NOTE: Screen reads on rising edge.
// NOTE: Host writes on falling edge.
// NOTE: Screen writes on falling edge.
// NOTE: Host reads on rising edge.
// NOTE: Clock starts low (polarity 0).
3 line mode embeds a D/CX bit in the packet
Write Flow (to ILI):
	1. Host set CSX low + set D/CX
	2. Rising SCL: ILI read D/CX
	3. Falling SCL: Host set D7
	4. Rising SCL: ILI read D7
	5. Falling SCL: Host set D6
	6. Rising SCL: ILI read D6
Need 10 us break after RESX
CSX stop in the middle of command/data: partial byte is discarded
Break in multiple parameters: accept full bytes, discard partial
Pauses between parameters are fine
2 data transfer modes: 16 and 18 bpp



MCU 8080-II
-----------
CSX is active low, enables the ILI9341
RESX is active low, external reset signal
WRX is parallel data write strobe
RDX is parallel data read strobe
Latches input on rising edge of WRX
D[17:0] is parallel data
Write cycle: WRX high -> low -> high
Read cycle: RDX high -> low -> high
Origin in the top left. Display is portrait.
