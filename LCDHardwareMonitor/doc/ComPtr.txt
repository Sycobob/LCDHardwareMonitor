Use of the WRL ComPtr is preferred for a couple reasons
  1) Querying interfaces is much simpler with As()
  2) It allows temporary pointers to be created on the stack and cleaned up
     without any additional bookkeeping.

ComPtrs should usually be passed as raw pointers for simplicity. However, an
exception is common utility functions like SetDebugObjectName where the constant
.Get() would be annoying.

Remember operator& maps to ReleaseAndGetAddressOf()
