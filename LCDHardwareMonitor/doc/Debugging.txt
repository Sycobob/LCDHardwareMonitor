Visual Studio Graphics Debugging
	The graphics debugger will not work properly if you don't have a swap chain and call present.
	Capturing a frame will hang indefinitely. The solution appears to be capturing frames
	programmatically: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh780905.aspx. Unfortunately, this
	doesn't allow you to use the Graphics Debugger GUI to capture. You have to capture from code and
	load the log in the GUI. The gist of the capture process is:
		#define DONT_SAVE_VSGLOG_TO_TEMP
		#include <vsgcapture.h>
		VsgDbgInit("relpath/to/some.vsglog");
		VsgDbgEndCapture();
		VsgDbgBeginCapture();
		VsgDbgUnInit();
