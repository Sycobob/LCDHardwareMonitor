Shared Memory

File Mapping            Basically shared memory. Sounds acceptable.
Sockets                 Low level. Sounds acceptable.
Pipes                   Send data back and forth. Maybe ok.
Mailslots               Simple messages only?
Remote Procedure Calls  Call functions directly. Meh.

IPC Method
1) The GUI reads application memory directly to get the things to display
2) The GUI requests lists of data and keeps a local copy

Process Structure
Simulation and GUI are independent processes
Each can start the other if necessary

Crazy Idea
The GUI could just be a plugin and run in the simulation
